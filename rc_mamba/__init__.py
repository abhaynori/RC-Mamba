"""Top‑level package for RC‑Mamba.

This package provides the core modules for the Retrieval‑Conditioned Mamba (RC‑Mamba) architecture, quantization schemes, retrieval pipeline, adaptation mechanisms, training loops, evaluation utilities, and a simple user interface.

Most modules are skeletons meant to illustrate design patterns and serve as a starting point for implementing the full functionality described in the accompanying research plan.  See the README.md for an overview.
