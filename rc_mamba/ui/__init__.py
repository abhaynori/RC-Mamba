"""User interface for RC‑Mamba.

This package contains a simple Gradio app to interact with an RC‑Mamba model.
Run `python -m rc_mamba.ui.app` from the project root after installing the
package to launch the UI.  The app demonstrates dynamic retrieval updates
during generation and displays the retrieved passages alongside the model’s
responses.
